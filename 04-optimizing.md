# Optimizing your images

## Controlling layers and making builds faster
How you construct your Dockerfile can have a big impact on your image sizes.  Keeping images compact, decreases the time to pull an image down or convert images for use by Shifter.  Here are a few tips to reduce image sizes.

### Cleanup within the construction of a layer
Each RUN statement will result in a new layer.  For example, let's look at the following.

```
RUN wget http://hostname.com/mycode.tgz
RUN tar xzf mycode.tgz
RUN cd mycode ; make; make install
RUN rm -rf mycode.tgz mycode
```

This will result in four layers.  Unfortunately, the cleanup line in the last RUN line will not reduce the amount of data that must be pulled from the Docker registry.  Instead, it will mask or "white-out" the files so they don't appear when executing the image.

In contrast, let's examine the following.

```
RUN wget http://hostname.com/mycode.tgz && \
 tar xzf mycode.tgz && \
 cd mycode && make && make install && \
 rm -rf mycode.tgz mycode
 ```

This image size will be much smaller since the cleanup happens inside the layer construction.  Also, notice the use of "&&" between commands.  This is good practice so that failures are detected and will stop the build.  Using a semi-colon like was done above means that the make could fail but the build would continue on.

## Multi-stage Builds (new in Docker 17.05)

Multi-stage builds allow build to have multiple phases to create genereated files that can be copied into the final image.
For example, one phase could install compilers that are used to generate compiled binaries and then those binaries could
be copied into a more compact runtime image that wouldn't need to contain all the tools required for the build.  This can
result in smaller images.  It can also be used to generate public images that make use of commercial tools such as compilers.

Using this is fairly easy.  The Dockerfile will contain multiple FROM stanzas and files can be copied from one stage to the
next adding a --from argument to the COPY command. For example...

```
FROM centos:7 as build

RUN yum -y install gcc make
ADD code.c /src/code.c
RUN gcc -o /src/mycode /src/code.c

FROM centos:7
COPY --from=build /src/mycode /usr/bin/mycode
```

The image is built as usual.

```
docker build -t myimage .
```

Even in this toy example, the image is over 100 MB smaller compared to the build image.

```
$ docker images|head -3
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              SIZE
myimage             latest              c0fadb85b093        About a minute ago   197MB
<none>              <none>              4b2009ca9ca4        5 minutes ago        323MB
```

## What goes in the image and what should stay out

While Docker doesn't typically impose strict limits on image sizes, larger images are more prone to failure for a variety of reasons.  Some Docker deployments may have limited disk space to store images.  Pulling down large layers can trigger timeouts or other failures.  Here are some best practices to follow.

* Limit image sizes to a few GB.  Avoid exceeding 10GB or more.
* Avoid "Kitchen sink" images that contain extraneous applications or tools
* Limit layer sizes using the technique above
* Avoid including data sets in the image unless they are relatively small and static.  Data can be mapped into the image using volume mounts (-v option).
* Limit images to the specific target applications and only add what is needed to support that application.
